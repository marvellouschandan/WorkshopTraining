# INTRODUCTION 

The process of giving a desired shape to a metal piece by heating and hammering is known as forging. The metal piece is heated up to a desired temperature, known as forging temperature. The processes involved in forging are hammering, pressing, swaging, bending and flattening etc. When the forging is done by the hand tools manually then it is called as hand forging. When the same forging is performed by the power hammer then it is called as power forging, in case it is drop stamp then it is drop forging. The metal pieces are heated to the plastic stage either in smith's forge or in a furnace. Forging is widely done in auto and bicycle industries. It has the following advantages over the other machining processes: 

1. lt refines the structure of the metal. 
1. It increases the Strength. 
1. It saves time, material and labour.
