    Tuyere : 
    :  A pipe coming from the bottom or rear of the hearth is known as tuyere. It is used to supply the air at high pressure. 

    Hood : 
    :  The upper part of the furnace is called hood. It is made up of mild steel sheet with fire bricks inside it. 

    Chimney : 
    :  Chimney is fitted on the upper end of the hood. It is used for the purpose of easy escaping of exhaust gases and smoke.

    :  A small iron tank is attached with the hearth of the furnace. It is used for dipping purposes. 

    Accessories for a forging furnace: 

    Shovel : 
    :  It is used to place the coal into the furnace hearth.
 
    Blower : 
    :  It is used to supply air at high pressure to the hearth.
 
    Poker : 
    :  It is a bent rod used to strike the fire. Poker is made up of mild steel. 

    Regulator : 
    :  It is used to control the supply of air to the hearth. Air supply is controlled by increasing or decreasing the passage of air. 

Anvil : 
:  A block on which forging work is done is known as anvil. It is made up of a cast iron, steel or wrought iron. It acts as a supporting device for all forging operations since it is capable of withstanding very heavy blows. The anvil is supported either on 3 iron base, or wooden block or mounted on the foundation. Weight of the anvil varies from 100 to 150 kg. It is available in many sizes and shapes. Common type of anvil used in forging shop has the following parts: 

  * Body 
  * Horn 
  * Chipping block 
  * Face 
  * Hardie hole 
  * Hound hole 
  * Tail 
  * Stand 

    The central part is known as body. The projected end is called horn. It is used for making circular jobs. A steel plate riveted on the body is called face. Most of the work is done on face. Chipping block is used for cutting purposes. Holes are used for chisels or punches. At the bottom four legs are attached. 

Hammers : 
:  Hammers are used as striking tools. These are classified as under : 

  * Hand Hammer 
  * Sledge Hammer 
  * Power Hammer 

    Hand hammer is light in weight used by the smith himself. Sledge hammer is heavier in weight and is used by the smith’s helper. All the hammers are divided into four parts namely pean, eye, cheeks and face. Hand hammer are of four types based on the shape of the pean. If the pean is along the axis of the handle then it is straight pean hammer when the pean is across the axis of the handle then it is called cross pean hammer, in case shape of the pean in same as shape of the face then it is double ended. If the shape of the pean is spherical then it is ball pean hammer. The weight of hand hammer varies from 1 kg to 2 kg and that of sledge hammer is 3 kg to 8 kg. 

Tongs : 
:  Tongs are used for holding and turning hot metal pieces. Depending upon their use, tongs are classified into many types. All types of tongs have similar construction except the mouth. A tong has two legs riveted from a suitable place. These are made up of mild steel. It is made in two pieces and both the pieces are joined by hinges.The length of the tongs vary from 12" to the 18". It is classified based on the shape of the mouth of the tongs. 

Chisels : 
:  Chisels are used for cutting metal places in hot and cold state. Chisels are divided Into following categories: 

  * Hot Chisel 
  * Cold Chisel 
  * Hardie Set 

    Hot chisel is used to cut the metal in hot state and cold chisel to cut the metal in cold state. Main difference between these chisels is the cutting angle. In hot chisel the cutting angle is 30°. But in case of cold chisel its value is 60°. A hardie set consists of the three parts: 

  * Shank 
  * Body 
  * Cutting edge 

    The shank is fitted into the hardie hole in an anvil. Chisels and the hardie set are made from carbon steels. It is hardened up to the desired level with proper tempering. 

Flatters : 
:  As indicated by the name, flatters are used to flatten the workpiece. It has a plane face joined with a straight shank. It is held in a thin wire. The material of the flatters is high carbon steel. The body of a flatter is square in cross section. 

Swage Block : 
:  It is a cast iron or cast steel rectangular block having a number of holes on it. Holes are made in different sizes and shapes. It's outer sides are also made in sectional forms to receive various types of jobs. It is always plane on a cast iron frame.
