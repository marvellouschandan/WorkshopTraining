# INTRODUCTION 

Welding is a process of joining two materials with the help of heat or pressure or by some other means. The cost of welding is very less as compared to other processes and forms a strong joint. For this reason it is largely used in the following fields of engineering: 

1. Manufacturing of machine tools, auto parts, cycle parts etc. 
1. Fabrication of farm machinery and equipment. 
1. Fabrication of buildings, bridges and ships. 
1. Construction of boilers, furnaces, railways, cars, airplanes, rockets and missiles. 
1. Manufacturing of television sets, refrigerators, kitchen cabinets etc. 

Main purpose of welding is to join two pieces. For this initially temperature of the parent metal is raised up-to melting point, then filler metal is used as a supplement for molten pool. A homogeneous mixture is formed at the joint then it is allowed to solidify to form a weld. This is fusion welding. 

In next process the ends to be joined are brought to the plastic stage and then apply external pressure to join them. It is pressure welding. In both the above cases the source of heat is as follows, for example, it is furnace in forge welding, it is gases in gas welding it is electrical energy in Arc welding, it is chemical reactions in Thermit welding etc.
