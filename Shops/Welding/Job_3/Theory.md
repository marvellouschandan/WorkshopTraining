## THEORY 

Spot welding is one of the type of resistance welding. Its the one of the easy and simplest way of welding. In spot welding two or more pieces of metal are held in between two copper electrodes applying pressure then passing sufficient current to make weld. In spot welding no filler metal is used. Pressure and weld time are fundamental variable of spot welding. Only a lap joint can be make.
