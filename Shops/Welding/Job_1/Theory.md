## THEORY 

Welding current, inert gas supply, water are turned on. Electric arc is struck between the non-consumable tungsten electrode and the work piece by touching the electrode with work piece or using a high frequency unit. A high frequency current is super imposed on the welding current. Welding torch is brought near to the job, when electron tip reaches within a distance of 3 to 2 mm from job a Spark jumps across the air gap between the electrode and job, air path gets ionized and are is established. 

TIG welding is also known as gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) both the ac and dc power source can be used for GTAW. Electrode employed varied in dia from 0.5 to 6.5 mm carrying current from 5 amp to 650 amp. Welding torch used for carrying current higher than 100 amp is normally water cooled.
