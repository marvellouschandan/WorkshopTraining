## THEORY  

MIG Welding is define as metal inert gas welding. It is also one of the type of arc welding. In this process no pressure is applied for welding. In this process of welding wherein coalescence is produced by heat the workpiece with an electric arc establish between a continues feed of metal electrode (copper coated) and the work piece. No flux is used, as used in submerged arc welding (SAW) but a shielding gas (Ar, He, CO~2~) is used. It is also known as Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW).
