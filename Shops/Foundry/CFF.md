# Coke-Fired Furnace 

These furnaces are generally installed in a formed pit and are used for melting small quantities of ferrous metals for producing iron castings and also for non-ferrous metals and alloys. They are provided with refractory lining inside and a chimney at the top. Coke is used as fuel. Broken pieces of metal are placed in the crucible. Bed coke is fired in the furnace and the crucible placed into it. Afterwards cake is placed all around the crucible.
